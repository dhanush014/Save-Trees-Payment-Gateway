    <h2 class="darkgreen">Why Donate to us?</h2><br>
    <p>When we donate to a charitable organization, we help make the <br> difference we’re unable to provide with our own hands. Consequently, <br> social impact organizations don’t just work to achieve their mission <br> they also empower individuals to effect change. They mobilize people <br> to play a part in making the world a better place.
<br> And as it turns out, when you take this opportunity to give to the causes <br> you care about, beneficiaries aren’t the only ones who reap the rewards <br> you do too. Check out this infographic to learn why donating your <br> dollars and time can be the best thing you do for yourself. 
Without you,<br>
 social impact organizations couldn’t exist. Without you, a cry for help <br>
  goes unanswered, a problem goes unsolved. Whether it funds a<br> nonprofit’s program or its operations, your donation is vital to their <br> ability to advance their mission and grow. </p>
